### Tips!
Try to keep moving so you don't get overwhelmed by the enemies!

The Max Health Upgrade also heals you to Max HP!

The white pickup that sometimes drops when you kill an enemy will pull all pickups currently in the game to you! Make sure to try and grab it when you see it!

The Projectile Bounce Upgrade is currently the most powerful as it increase the amount of times a single projectile can do damage!

The Pickup Range upgrade helps a ton in the early game so grabing one or two of it will help you snowball in power!
